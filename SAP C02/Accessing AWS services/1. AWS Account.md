#aws #account

## Purpose
#### Adrian 
- any solution developed operates inside an AWS account. 
- but if the system is complex or its large enterprise environment it can run across multiple AWS accounts

## Configuration
#### Adrian
- It is a container with identities and aws resources
- identities is a correct way of referring to things like users, that can log in to the aws
- and resources are provisioned to those users in that account
	- The account needs to have a name (like DEV or PROD) and an unique email address
	- Email address is used to create a spl type of entity, **Account root user**
		- This ARU can only access this account and act as root
		- This ARU is the first identity or the user created for any account at inception
		- This ARU has full control over this account, to create anything without any restriction
		- The username and password of ARU needs to be protected at all cost else the whole account will get compromised
	- also a credit card (which can be shared among multiple email or users)
		- This is the account payment method
		- using which resources can be created by payment
		- The bill from those resources will be charged on the credit card (pay as you go, and free tier)
- Identity creation
	- To create more users or identities, the account can use **Identity Access Management** #iam
	- These new identities can be give full or limited access (user, group and roles)
	- The default permission is fully restricted to any newly created identity thats not ARU
	- Usually these identities cant access anything beyond the account they are created in but there is way to do that using cross account permissions
- Boundary of the account
	- Acts as a filter, so that nothing from inside goes out and nothing from outside the account comes in
	- This was any damage in the account doesn affect anything beyond its boundary
	- And any external threat is not harmful to the resources inside the account boundary
	- only compromised if the ARU creds are leaked
- Separate accounts
	- can be for environment, teams, products or clients

## Internal working
#### Adrian
- Creation
	- aws.amazon.com
	- create account
	- aws account name must indicate the purpose of the account
	- username+aws account name@gmail.com (will allow you to have multiple email address but leading to just one)
	- Verify the email, create password,  enter details
- Once done, sign into console
	- Select root user and sign in
	- Make sure the region in drop down is N. Virginia
	- Beside the region, click on the drop down and select my account  to go to the account console where all private information is stored
	- Scroll down and in alternate contacts, usually different people details are registered here
		- For billing operations and security
		- For aws to reach out
	- Scroll down and go to IAM user and role access billing
		- Edit and activate IAM access
		- Now IAM users and roles can also see billing info
- MFA
